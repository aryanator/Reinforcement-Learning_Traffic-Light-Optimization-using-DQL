# Reinforcement Learning_Traffic Light Optimization using DQL
The project is a Traffic Light optimization system.
I have used SUMO simulator to generate traffic scenarios and would be training a Deep QL(Neural Network based algorithm) to train on the traffic patterns to find optimal traffic light system and reduce congestion in the network.

1. The SUMO_SIMULATION folder contains the simulation required for the project. This folder contains a RL_env.py file. Run this file to create a simulation of traffic. This will produce some files which will be used in the next step.
2. The MODELS dolder contains two models. First is the Q-Learning algorithm used in Reinforcement Learning and the second is Deep Q-Learning Algorithm. Goal is to compare and analyze the results of the two algorithms.

For more info about the models, algorithms, formulas, and results, please take a look at the TrafficRL_Report.
